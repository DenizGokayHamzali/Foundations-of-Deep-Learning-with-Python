# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consist of 60000 images in 10 different classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

The CNN architecture used in this project consists of three convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. The final layer uses a softmax activation function to output class probabilities.
