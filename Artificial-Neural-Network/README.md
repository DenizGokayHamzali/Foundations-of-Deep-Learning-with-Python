# Multi-Class Classification of Date Fruit Types using Neural Networks

The goal of this project is to use a neural network to classify different types of date fruits based on various features such as weight, size, and color.

The dataset used in this project is Date_Fruit_Dataset.xlsx, which contains the features and type (7 different types) for each date fruit.

## Conclusion
The neural network is a powerful tool for multi-class classification problems. By using this algorithm, we can accurately predict the type of fruit based on various features. 

## Model Performance
The final model was trained using 100 epochs, and demonstrated strong performance with a test accuracy of 93.33% and a low loss value of 0.3616. This indicates that the model was effectively trained and successfully generalized to new data.
